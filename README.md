# LungCancerDataAnalysis
This research aims to investigate the correlation between many clinical and
demographic variables, such as age, gender, smoking history, tumor size, tumor
location, cancer stage, therapy type, and survival months, in lung cancer patients.
The main objective is to examine the correlation between these characteristics and
assess their impact on the survival rates of lung cancer patients. Various statistical
methods like hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, chi-square test for independence, and ANOVA testing will be employed to estimate the associations between these variables.
